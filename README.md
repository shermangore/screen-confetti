# screen-confetti
Uses a single line of JavaScript to display confetti on your screen.

### Details
The confetti is generated using random number generators for the color and location of each piece of confetti.  
Ten separate div tags are used as the individual pieces of the confetti and are sized at 10px X 10px.

### Future Enhancements
* Possibly include functionality to increase/decrease the size of the confetti bits
* Randomly generate different shapes of confetti
